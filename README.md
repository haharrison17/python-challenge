PyBank:
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset
  We found 86 Total Months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  The total amount of Profit/Losses is: $38,382,578.00 In the python file you will see it calculated as 'Revenue' but final print is under 'Profit'

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  The average of Profit/Loss changes is: $7803

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  The greatest increase in profit's occured in February 2012 with $1,926,159

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  The greatest decrease in profit's occured in September 2013, losing -$2,196,167

PyPoll:
In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.


You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast
  =3521001

A complete list of candidates who received votes
  Khan, Correy, Li, and O'Tooley received votes during the election

The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election based on popular vote.
